# DBScan
This is an implementation of DBScan using Python. Libraries such as numpy, pandas have been used. The DBScan algorithm has been tested on two chameleon datasets - t4.8k and t5.8k. The results obtained are then visualised with the help of matplotlib. For comparision purposes, the output obtained is compared with the results from DBScan implementation of sklearn library. Homogeneity and Separation for each of the datasets are computed in order to observe similarity and dissimilarity measures between the clusters. The values of epsilon and min_points have been taken as 8.5 and 16.5 respectively.
